          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>This tool combines steganography with cryptography, allowing the user to encrypt and hide a file within a completely different and unrelated file, so that it can be transmitted or shared while allowing only the intended parties to view the hidden file.</p>
          <p>The hidden file can be decrypted and visible again by running the combined file through the tool.</p>
          <p>In the case that an attacker intercepted the file in transmission, the attacker should be unable to view or even know the existence of the hidden file without our tool or symmetric key.</p>
